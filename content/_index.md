# All-Inclusive Rent
Your rent is all you pay. Water, electricity and parking are provided at no extra charge, and you won't have to worry about activation, utility deposits or transfers. 

# Pet-Friendly
Ranch Hand Apartments welcomes your pet, and requires no pet deposit! You and your pet will love the extra space you have, since each and every apartment has its own private fenced-in back yard. Compare our pets-welcome approach to other apartments and we know you’ll agree, Ranch Hand Apartments are the ideal spot if you can’t live without your best furry friend!

# Ideal Location
Ranch Hand Apartments are on the outskirts of Canyon, TX and have the feel of country life. But with close access to US Highway 60, you are just minutes away from the WTAMU campus, as well as Wal-Mart and United.

Ranch Hand Apartments are also centrally located between Palo Duro Creek Golf Course and Canyon Country Club, so you’re also close to the best outdoor recreation our community has to offer.
